## Text Editors/IDE's
- Visual Studio Code (development)
- Sublime Text (notes)

## MacOSX stuff
- BetterSnapTool: hotkeys for arranging windows
- Alfred: A better `Cmd+Space` Spotlight/search tool.

## Terminal
- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
  - [kimfork-robbyrussel.zsh-theme](kimfork-robbyrussel.zsh-theme): My fork of Robby Russel's Oh My ZSH theme. At the time of writing, the only change I made was to display the full path instead of the current working directory. See [this Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27885057/zsh-theme-for-full-path-display-git-changes) for more info.
